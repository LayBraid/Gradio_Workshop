## X - Gradio interface ðŸ“±

Discover Gradio, a tool to create interfaces for your artificial intelligence applications.

You will:
- Automatic download your dataset
- Save and load your weights of your model
- Display your accuracy and loss
- Create a Gradio interface
- Use different Gradio interfaces
- Share your app on the Gradio platform

## Workspace

For this workshop you will not use a jupyter notebook. You will create your own application.
You will follow this architecture to start and then you are free to change it to make your application grow.

```
Folder: gradio_app

â”œâ”€â”€ my_app.py
â”‚   dataset/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (Empty folder)
â”‚   weights/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (Empty folder)
```

## Dataset (CHANGE THE DATASET)

In this workshop you will use the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

## Step 0: Initialization

All the required information to install the workshop's dependencies are given in the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

## Step 1: Class app

Create a class called `app` that will be the main class of your application.

In the class `app` you will add the following attributes:
- `model`: the model of your application
- `epoch`: the number of epochs
- `batch_size`: the batch size
- `learning_rate`: the learning rate
- `classes`: the list of classes

## Step 2: Add the dataset

- In your class app create an attribute `train_loader` and an attribute `test_loader` that will contain the dataset.
- In your class app you will create an attribute `classes` that will contain the classes of your dataset.
- Create a method called `add_dataset` that will return a dataloader.

The `add_dataset` method will receive a `dataset_name`, `dataset_path` and if you want a train set or test set.

## Step 2.5: Check if the dataset is already downloaded

In your method `add_dataset` you will check if the dataset is already downloaded.
If it is downloaded, check if the dataset is correct.

## Step 3: Create the model

Create a class called `model` that will contain the model of your application.

In your init method of the class `model` you will add the following attributes:
- `conv1`: the first convolutional layer
- `pool`: the pooling layer
- `conv2`: the second convolutional layer
- `linear1`: the first linear layer
- `linear2`: the second linear layer
- `linear3`: the third linear layer

Create a forward method that will receive the input of your model and use the model variables.

## Step 4: Implement the training

Create a method called `train` that will train your model.

In the method `train` you will:
- Create a loss function
- Create a optimizer
- Keep track of the loss and accuracy
- Create a loop to train the model

## Step 5: Display the loss and accuracy

Use Matplotlib for this step.

In one figure you will display the loss and accuracy of the training.


## Step 6: Save the weights

After your training, you will save the weights of your model in the `weights` folder.

## Step 7: Predict an image

Create a method named `predict` that will predict an image.
This method will receive an image and return the prediction.
The prediction is an element of the `classes` attribute.

## Step 8: Create the Gradio interface
